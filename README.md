*S10-T01: classification algorithms with scikit-learn*


Learn how to use Python to perform supervised learning specifically classification algorithms with scikit-learn.

Classification is a procedure for identifying spectrally similar areas on an image by identifying 'training' sites of known targets and then extrapolating those spectral signatures to other areas of unknown targets. It requires training data which are typical and homogeneous and the application of a set of methods, or decision rules.

Become familiar and learn about classification algorithms.
